## 1. Project name:
Body Mass Index Calculator

## 2. Description:
For this project, I created a body mass index calculator. The program takes in two pieces of data from the user(weight and height) and after calculating the index with the specific mathematical formula, gives back a body status check based on the resulting BIM. The possible results are: obese, overweight, normal, and underweight.

## 3. Contents:
**bmi_calculator.py** - This file contains the whole program. It allows the user to calculate the BMI index and to get a body check status based on the result.

## 4. Installation:
To run and use this program is necessary to install a recent version of Python that can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## 5. Usage:
Open and run the file bmi_calculator.py. Follow the instructions displayed on the console and insert the necessary inputs to get the output.<br>
Following you can find a screenshot that shows how the program should run:<br><br>

**- Be sure to have on your machine a recent and correctly working version of Python.**

## 6. Credits:
This program was created by me, during the **DfE Skills Bootcamp** provided by **HyperionDev** (https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
